# E02a-Operators
In this assignment we went over the operators and data types in python. In the main.py the first operators were the basic operators. The basic operators are addition, substraction, divison, multiplication, etc. The basic operators were the easiest parts of the assignments, the hardest part of the assignment were the data types. They were the hardest part, because I've never had experience with them unlike the basic operators. To get past this obstacle I used the links that were given to help me, I searched othe programming websites, and I watched YouTube videos that went over what each data type does. Although, many of the data types were difficult I managed to finished all of them and they didn't take a lot of coding to do them.
